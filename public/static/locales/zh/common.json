Direct selling often eliminates several middlemen involved in product distribution, such as regional distribution centres and wholesalers. <br> <br> Instead, products go from manufacturer to the direct sales company, the distributor or representative, and then to the consumer. The products sold through direct sales are usually not found in typical retail locations. <br> <br> This means that finding a distributor or representative is the only way to buy the products or services.",

We accomplish this by leveraging rapid innovation and technology while ensuring that everyone has equal rights to economic resources and opportunities. As more than 20,000 new apps and software are released daily, 365 days a year, the concept of “free” not only prevents entrepreneurs from succeeding (as the apps drown in the abundance of new tech), but it also prevents developing countries from finding and accessing new content. Impact Crowd Technology, in partnership with Crowd1, intends to distribute other companies’ software through its network, not only in the western world, but especially to developing nations. Customer acquisition costs, in the form of sales commissions (as opposed to advertising), will be allocated to neglected geographical areas and to people who want and need an income.",
