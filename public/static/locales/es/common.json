As more than 20,000 new apps and software are released daily, 365 days a year, the concept of “free” not only prevents entrepreneurs from succeeding (as the apps drown in the abundance of new tech), but it also prevents developing countries from finding and accessing new content. Impact Crowd Technology, in partnership with Crowd1, intends to distribute other companies’ software through its network, not only in the western world, but especially to developing nations.
